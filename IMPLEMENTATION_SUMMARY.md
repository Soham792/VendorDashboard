## 📋 **Feature Comparison**

| Feature | Before (AI Generation) | After (Upload) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Image Source** | AI Generated (Gemini) | Vendor Uploaded |
| **Cost** | API calls required | Free |
| **Quality** | Generic/Synthetic | Authentic dish photos |
| **Control** | Limited | Full vendor control |
| **Reliability** | Depends on API | Always available |
| **Performance** | API call delay | Instant processing |

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Image Upload Flow:**
1. **File Selection** → Drag/drop or click to browse
2. **Validation** → Check file type and size
3. **Preview** → Create blob URL for immediate display
4. **Processing** → Convert to base64 for storage
5. **Storage** → Save in MongoDB as data URL
6. **Cleanup** → Release blob URLs to prevent memory leaks

### **File Structure:**
```
frontend/src/
├── utils/
│   ├── imageUpload.js          ✅ New utility functions
│   └── imageUpload.test.js     ✅ Test functions
├── pages/
│   └── MenuManagement.jsx      ✅ Updated with upload UI
└── .env                        ✅ Cleaned (no Gemini key)
```
